satPY Scraper is a modular, protocol based high resolution satellite image scraper which utilizes the Tor network for HTTP/HTTPS web scraping capabilities as well as some FTP support. 

Here is an .gif file created by satellite images scraped by this program from January 26th - January 27th.

### Elektro-L2

<p align="center">The Electro-L satellite is Russia's second high-altitude weather observatory, coming after a troubled mission launched in 1994 that never achieved all of its goals The next-generation Electro-L program faced years of delays because of interruptions in funding. The Electro-L spacecraft will function for up to 10 years, collecting weather imagery several times per hour with visible and infrared cameras.</p>
